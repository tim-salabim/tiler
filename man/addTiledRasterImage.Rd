\title{Add a tiled raster image to a leaflet map}
\usage{
addTiledRasterImage(map, x, minzoom = 0, maxzoom, color = sp::bpy.colors,
  at, na.color = "#BEBEBE")

addTiledImage(map, x, minzoom = 0, maxzoom)
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{a leaflet map}

\item{x}{for \code{addTiledRasterImage} a RasterLayer, for \code{addTiledImage}
a file path to the image to be tiled.}

\item{minzoom}{minimum zoom of the map}

\item{maxzoom}{maximum zoom of the map. This will be set as the maximum zoom
during tile generation. If missing, it is calculated based on image dimensions.}

\item{color}{the color palette to be used}

\item{at}{optionally specify breaks}

\item{na.color}{color for NA values}
}
\description{
Create tiled image data and add to a leaflet or mapview map. The image data
can be in the form of a character vector pointing to a file on disk such as
.png, .jpg, .bmp, .tif files or a RasterLayer from the \code{raster} package. \cr
\cr
\strong{NOTE:} \cr In case you want to save your map with tiled imagery using
\code{htmlwidgets::saveWidget} or \code{mapview::mapshot} make sure you set
\code{libdir = "lib"} as otherwise tiles won't render in your .html.
}
\details{
add non-projected/non-geographical tiled images to a non-projected
leaflet map for better performance. The map should be set up with
\code{leafletCRS(crsClass = "L.CRS.Simple")} - see example below. \cr
\cr
The use of these functions requires some system libraries to be installed.
First and foremost, GDAL needs to be available on your system. Furthermore,
you will need to have the \code{python-gdal} bindings. Installing GDAL
is pretty straight forward for most systems and chances are you have it already,
given that you were able to install \code{mapview}. The \code{gdal-python} bindings
require some extra work. \cr
\cr
If you're useing a debian \strong{linux} system \cr
\cr
\code{sudo apt-get install python-gdal} \cr
\cr
should be sufficient.\cr
\cr
On \strong{windows} (as usual) things are a more involved. \cr
The following describes how to get things set up to get these functions working
under windows:

\enumerate{
  \item{
    Download and install Python from \url{https://www.python.org/ftp/python},
    e.g. python-2.7.9.amd64.msi for Python 2.7 64-bit (assumed in the following)
  }
  \item{
    From \url{http://www.gisinternals.com/release.php}, download and install \cr
      1. GDAL core, e.g. gdal-203-1911-x64-core.msi, \cr
      2. then GDAL Python bindings, e.g. GDAL-2.3.0.win-amd64-py2.7.msi
  }
  \item{
    Add required GDAL paths to system variables: \cr
      1. PATH: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GDAL \cr
      2. GDAL_DATA: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GDAL\\gdal-data \cr
      3. GDAL_DRIVER_PATH: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GDAL\\gdalplugins \cr
  }
  \item{
    Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 from
    \url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=44266}
    (required for installation of numpy package)
  }
  \item{
    Download and extract numpy (e.g. numpy-1.14.3.zip from
    \url{https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b0/2b/497c2bb7c660b2606d4a96e2035e92554429e139c6c71cdff67af66b58d2/numpy-1.14.3.zip}).
    On the command line, navigate to decompressed folder and run \cr
    \cr
      >>> python setup.py install
    \cr
  }
  \item{
    To verify, run the following import statements in the Python shell on the command line: \cr
      \cr
      >>> import gdal \cr
      >>> import ogr \cr
      >>> import osr \cr
      >>> import gdalnumeric \cr
      >>> import gdalconst \cr
  }
}

  \item{\url{https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/tutorials/installing-gdal-for-windows}} \cr
}
for further details.

On a \strong{mac} you're on your own for now (we don't have testing opportunities).
Though we would appreciate a PR if you feel confident you have a solution for
installing all needed dependencies/prerequisites.
